CSC 462 Final Project - Visual Effects Demo Reel
Mark DeMaria & Ben Hughes

==== Screencasts ====
Scene 01 - Nanites (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P42MzMnxxZI)
Scene 02 - Volcano (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WcFMtVLaA)
Scene 03 - Flubber (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy8ftPL2fs8)

==== Claims ====
We claim 135% completion on this project (Parts 1-10 of our proposal) because we completed Scene 03 in addition to Scenes 01 & 02.

==== Description ====
The video links provided show a live-action visual effects composition of three scenes. The first is a nanite swarm composited into footage of an EB2 hallway. The second is a volcano in a small parking lot. The third is a flubber creature on a kitchen counter.

==== Project Files ====
Due to Github's File Size Restrictions, a copy of our entire project can be found at this link:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw19t0ZavlgETW9yS0ZRNlJ3MTg

Upon downloading the entire directory listed in the above google drive folder, you'll need this specific build of Blender (http://graphicall.org/1200).

==== Folder Structure ====
/blend/ contains all of our Blender scene files. One per scene
/img/ contains the HDR maps for each scene. One per scene.
/mov/ contains our undistorted baseplate footage.
/renders/ contains our final renders in both PNG and H.264 encoding.
/undistort_mov/ contains our undistorted baseplate footage that we use for tracking.

==== Directions ====
Our projects cannot be "run". They can however be rendered. Upon opening Blender with the specific version mentioned above, you can do a test render by hitting F12 on your keyboard. Use the timeline scrubber on the bottom-ish of your screen to move the timeline around. If it freezes (especially with the volcano scene) give it a moment, as it is doing some calculating for the fluid lava sim.

If you have ANY questions, please do not hesitate to email myself (MDeMari@ncsu.edu) or Ben (blhughe2@ncsu.edu).
